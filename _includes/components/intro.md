Currently, I am a third-year PhD student in the number theory team in the [UMPA laboratory](https://www.umpa.ens-lyon.fr/) (ENS de Lyon) under the supervision of [Benjamin Wesolowski](https://www.bweso.com/) and 
[Guillaume Hanrot](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/guillaume.hanrot/).
During my first year as a PhD student, I was part of the ARIC team in the [LIP laboratory](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/) (ENS de Lyon).

I am interested in the cryptographic applications of algorithmic number theory and algebraic geometry, especially in the context of isogeny-based post-quantum cryptography.

I completed a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Mathematics at the Universit√© de Rennes 1 with a specific focus on the mathematics of cryptography during my postgraduate studies.
