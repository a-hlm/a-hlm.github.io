Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at [COSIC](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/), KU Leuven, in the group of [Frederik Vercauteren](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/people/person/?u=u0031924).

I am interested in the cryptographic applications of algorithmic number theory and algebraic geometry, especially in the context of isogeny-based post-quantum cryptography.

My PhD was completed in the number theory team at the [UMPA laboratory](https://www.umpa.ens-lyon.fr/) (ENS de Lyon) under the supervision of [Benjamin Wesolowski](https://www.bweso.com/) and [Guillaume Hanrot](https://perso.ens-lyon.fr/guillaume.hanrot/).
During my first year as a PhD student, I was part of the ARIC team in the [LIP laboratory](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/) (ENS de Lyon).

Before that, I completed a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in Mathematics at the Université de Rennes 1 with a specific focus on the mathematics of cryptography during my postgraduate studies.
